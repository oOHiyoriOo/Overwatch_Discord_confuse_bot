# Overwatch_Discord_confuse_bot
Its a discord bot that sends keys (you can find under this text) to you ( its like you charing your keyboard with a friend ( the only think is that everyone who can message the bot can send you the following keys ))


- it have a basic auth (you get a id on start with wich you can chaneg status/ pb and quit the bot per discord)
- all keys that can be used:
```
!q = q
!e = e
!c = strg
!sh = shift
!p = schlagen (2)
!1 = schuss (click)
!w / !a / !s / !d = laufen
!r = r (Nachladen)
!j = Jump
°t <message> = Postet nachricht in den chat
°stat <id> <status-text> = ändert bot status
>code = zeigt deine id in der console
°pb <id> <link> = ändert das profielbild
```
- in the state now you can compile it via "Pyinstaller" to an .exe
- in case you just want to download the bot but have no python or anything: my releases ca be downloaded as exe here:

its funyn for streams so dont aks somehing like " why would anyone want this?!" its just a fun projekt :P
